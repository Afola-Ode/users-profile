### 3 List five major advantages of React
1. React's component-based architecture allows developers to create reusable UI components, which can be used across different parts of the application.
2. React uses a virtual DOM to keep track of changes and update the user interface without having to re-render the entire page every time there is a change.
3. It uses a one-way data binding model, which makes it easier to optimize the performance of the application.
4. React is highly flexible and can be used with a wide range of other tools and frameworks.
5. React can be used to build applications for web, mobile, and desktop platforms.

### 4. What is the name of the Software Engineer that created React? Also, which company owns React?

### 5. What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them
1. HTML uses a tag-based syntax, while JSX uses a syntax that looks like a combination of HTML and JavaScript. 
2. HTML attributes are defined using strings, while JSX attributes are defined using JavaScript expressions.
3. In HTML, comments are defined using `<!-- -->`, while in JSX, comments are defined using `{/* */}`.

### 6. Why canâ€™t browsers read JSX?
Browsers cannot read JSX because it is not a standard web technology, and it needs to be compiled into regular JavaScript before it can be executed by the browser.
